<b> Anomaly Detection: Credit Card Fraud </b>

This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using anomaly detection techniques. Unlike supervised learning, anomaly detection identifies rare, suspicious transactions by flagging those that deviate from normal behavior, making it ideal for detecting fraud with minimal labeled data.

Algorithms Used:

- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Autoencoders
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- DBSCAN
